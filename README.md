# Group 1 - Project 3, Separating Sound Data 

## Table of Contents
- SRC:
  - This folder contains all of the source code for our project. This folder contains all code used to load and combine the  data as well as structure the final model for training.
- DATA:
  - This folder is where we store all datasets being used for this project.
- Figures:
  -  This folder contains exploratory plots looking into the distribution of data. 

## SRC
### Installing/ Building our code
- It is recommended to run the notebook files in an IDE that supports both Jupyter Notebooks and R markdown files such as Pycharm.
- These files use the 'tidyverse' and 'dplyr' R libraries and the json, re, pickle, numpy, pandas and sklearn Python libraries
- File paths may be incorrect on your machine, you are recommended to check all file paths before running.
  
### Notebook Files
| Notebook Name | Decription |
| -------- | -------- |


### Usage
- To use this model, first unpickle it. Then call the sklearn method predict(data) to get predictions.

## DATA
### Dataset Dictionary
| Column Name | Definition |
